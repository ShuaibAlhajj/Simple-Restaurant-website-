## 2024-05-22 - [Modal Accessibility and Focus Management]
**Learning:** In static websites without component libraries, modal accessibility must be manually implemented. Key elements include role="dialog", aria-modal="true", converting non-semantic spans to buttons, and managing focus (storing trigger, focusing close button, restoring focus on close).
**Action:** Always implement focus restoration when closing modals and provide clear :focus-visible styles for keyboard users.

## 2024-05-23 - [Non-blocking Feedback and ARIA Filter States]
**Learning:** Native `alert()` calls are jarring and block the main thread, hurting the UX "flow". A lightweight toast system provides feedback without interruption. For menu filters, `aria-pressed` is essential for screen readers to understand the active selection in a list of toggle-like buttons.
**Action:** Replace all debug/info `alert()` calls with a toast system and ensure filter buttons use `aria-pressed`.
