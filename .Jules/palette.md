## 2024-05-22 - [Modal Accessibility and Focus Management]
**Learning:** In static websites without component libraries, modal accessibility must be manually implemented. Key elements include role="dialog", aria-modal="true", converting non-semantic spans to buttons, and managing focus (storing trigger, focusing close button, restoring focus on close).
**Action:** Always implement focus restoration when closing modals and provide clear :focus-visible styles for keyboard users.

## 2024-05-23 - [Non-blocking Feedback and ARIA Filter States]
**Learning:** Native `alert()` calls are jarring and block the main thread, hurting the UX "flow". A lightweight toast system provides feedback without interruption. For menu filters, `aria-pressed` is essential for screen readers to understand the active selection in a list of toggle-like buttons.
**Action:** Replace all debug/info `alert()` calls with a toast system and ensure filter buttons use `aria-pressed`.

## 2024-05-24 - [Scrollspy and Dynamic ARIA Labels]
**Learning:** For single-page navigation, visual feedback of the current section (Scrollspy) significantly aids orientation. Using `IntersectionObserver` with `rootMargin: "0px 0px -50% 0px"` ensures the active state changes as the section crosses the middle of the viewport. For dynamic elements like a cart button, updating the `aria-label` with live counts (e.g., "View Order Cart - 1 item") is more accessible than just visual counters.
**Action:** Implement `IntersectionObserver` for auto-updating navigation states and ensure interactive counters have descriptive `aria-label` updates.

## 2024-05-25 - [Accessible Character Counters on Dark-Themed Forms]
**Learning:** Adding live character counters to text areas in dark-themed interfaces requires sufficient visual contrast, real-time synchronization, and accessibility accommodations. Setting `aria-live="polite"` lets screen readers announce milestones politely. Association with the text area via `aria-describedby` (alongside existing error messages) provides initial state context. Dynamically recalculating the max length on reset avoids layout/state mismatches.
**Action:** Implement a dynamic, flex-aligned wrapper for error and character counter elements under the text field, and synchronize states gracefully across DOM initialization and form reset.
